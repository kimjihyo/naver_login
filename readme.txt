This module needs selenium moudle,so make sure the module is downloaded before you use this.
You can login to Naver with your id and pw by calling execute_login_process(). After calling the function, you will have to call close_login_session() to quit the webdriver

**
The location of chromedriver is very important. Please make sure that the chromedriver is in the same directory of naver_login.py. Otherwise you will have to change the location of chromedriver manually in naver_login.py.
